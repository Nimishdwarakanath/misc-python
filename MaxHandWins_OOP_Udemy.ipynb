    "# Max Hand Wins\n",
    "The following code is the project work for the course [\"Python OOP Course: Master Object-Oriented Programming\"](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-oop-course/) by Dr. Karim Elghamrawy on Udemy. I have used Python and OOP to simulate a *maximum-hand-wins* game based on playing cards. The rules of the game are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game, three players pick two cards each from a shuffled deck of playing cards per round. Each player then presents the stronger of the two cards they've picked. The player having the strongest among the presented cards is the winner for that round and gets a point. The player with the highest number of points at the end of the game is the winner. For two given cards, the one having a higher 'rank' (2 < 3 < ... < 9 < Jack < Queen < King < Ace) is stronger. In case the ranks are identical, the card having a higher 'suit' (clubs < diamonds < hearts < spades) is stronger among the two. \n",

    "The game, according to my implementation, can have --\n",
    "1. An arbitrary number of players can be present and\n",
    "2. Each player can pick any integer number of cards\n",
    "3. The Game can either last for a given number of rounds or until the cards in the deck are exhausted"
